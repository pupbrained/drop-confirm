## What *is* DropConfirm, exactly?

DropConfirm is a **configurable quality-of-life mod** that adds a confirmation dialog when dropping items. I made it
because I was tired of accidentally dropping my items to other players or into lava/voids.

I use this mod personally, and I wanted to share it with others because I've noticed that a lot of my friends have had
this exact problem (and I assume others have too).

## Compatibility

DropConfirm actively supports **all major versions from 1.14.4 onward**, with the help of Stonecutter and Modstitch.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add configurations
- [x] Add a command/keybinding to toggle the mod
- [x] Add sound events for toggling the mod and dropping items
- [x] Add translations

    - Whether to enable DropConfirm.

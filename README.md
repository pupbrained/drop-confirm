## What *is* DropConfirm, exactly?

DropConfirm is a **configurable quality-of-life mod** that adds a confirmation dialog when dropping items. I made it
because I was tired of accidentally dropping my items to other players or into lava/voids.

I use this mod personally, and I wanted to share it with others because I've noticed that a lot of my friends have had
this exact problem (and I assume others have too).

## Compatibility

DropConfirm currently supports Minecraft 1.20-1.21 (with a less feature-rich backport for 1.19.4).

Newer versions will likely be supported. Older versions may or may not work with some manual modifications to the source
and will ***not*** be actively supported.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add configurations
- [x] Add a command/keybinding to toggle the mod
- [x] Add sound events for toggling the mod and dropping items
- [x] Add translations

## Configuration

- **Enable:**
    - Whether to enable DropConfirm.
- **Play Sounds:**
    - Whether or not to play sounds when doing various actions related to DropConfirm, e.g.:
        - Enabling/Disabling
        - Dropping items
- **Reset Delay:**
    - Amount of time (in seconds) before the confirmation status is reset.
- **Blacklist**
    - Allows for disabling the confirmation prompt on certain items.
    - Can also be used like a whitelist instead.
